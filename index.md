I am a second-year M.S. student in <a href="https://eee.metu.edu.tr/" target="_blank">Electrical and Electronics Engineering</a> (EE) and a recent graduate of double major in EE and Physics at <a href="http://www.metu.edu.tr/" target="_blank">Middle East Technical University</a>.

<br />
My primary research interests are in the areas of computational imaging, machine learning, signal processing and optics.

<br />
During my undergraduate research and M.S. studies with <a href="https://blog.metu.edu.tr/figeno/" target="_blank">Asst. Prof. Figen S. Oktem</a>, I have particularly focused on the classical phase retrieval problem and phase-space optics. I have also worked on the resolution enhancement of microscopy images by exploiting deep learning algorithms and representation learning under the supervision of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aykut-ko%C3%A7-9a37abb5/" target="_blank">Dr. Aykut Koc</a>.
